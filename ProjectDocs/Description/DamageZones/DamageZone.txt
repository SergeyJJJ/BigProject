DamageZones it`s a zones that will apply periodic or instant damage to player (and may be to enemies).

Now we have three DamageZones:
* Water;
* Acid;
* Spikes;

Each one DamageZone will have trigger or collider to check if player (and may be enemies) is in danger zone
If it is than DamageZone will apply damage to player.

Also every DamageZone will have its own specific behawiour.
